!!! TO DO !!!
Make Footer Sticky so page size doesn't matter between main and signup
Finish Styles and link pages.



I just put all of the stock images that they gave you into one file for now seeing as there are only like 20 svg/png files. 

I spend probably like, 6 or 7 hours on this between dogs doing dog things and Julia doing Julia things. I'm not sure how slow 
  I was in comparison to what you're used to for the amount that I got done today. I'll probably putter on it some more later
  tonight and then work more tomorrow. 
  
Let me know how shameful I am at the moment. 


??? QUESTIONS ???
What's classy button animation for good UX? 

Best way to deal with the vector svg circles and getting them on the page? 
  - If I layer them as background then I can't have them overlap separate sections... unless I can?
  - Beacuse you're going to show me how to upload all of this with WordPress as a CMS, 
    I don't need to write PHP post fucntions for the form, correct?
